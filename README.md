[Archive] APIVersionPatcher
=================
This used to be the tool that could set a TShock plugin's API version to a higher (or lower) number, in accordance with server executables that you needed to provide. It likely doesn't work anymore and is likely impossible to update, due to Mono.Cecil not existing for .NET 6.
